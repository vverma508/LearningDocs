How to use dynamic models in anular?
How to play around with dynamic models in UI side ?

We can create dynamic variable as,

    $scope["commonText" + $scope.YourDynamicModelValue]= {};
    $scope["commonText" + $scope.YourDynamicModelValue].Text ="This is great".

Now how can you use this variable in HTML ?

It can be used with scope.
We can find the model from scope in HTML and use the value.

But, the problem is $scope isn't available in HTML.

You can use as shown below ,

  <input ng-model="this["commonText" +YourDynamicModelValue].Value"/>

  {{this["commonText" +YourDynamicModelValue].Value}}
